# Hello, I'm oldip 👋

I work in cybersecurity, with a strong interest in the field. I particularly enjoy researching emerging security threats and developing tools to address these challenges. My current focus is on malware analysis, threat intelligence, and penetration testing.

Although my experience is still growing, I am committed to continuous learning and improving my skills through practice. I also enjoy working with various hardware tools, such as Flipper Zero, and have developed some auxiliary tools like [FlipperNestedRecovery-GUI](https://github.com/oldip/FlipperNestedRecovery-GUI) and [DumpNFC Converter](https://github.com/oldip/DumpNFC-Converter) to simplify processes and enhance user experience.

Thank you for your attention and support. I will continue to work hard to contribute more to the field of cybersecurity.
